In this section I have compiled the software, websites and other resources that I use on a daily basis in my research.
\
\
**Software**

*Reference manager*

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): In my opinion, the best reference manager (available for Windows, Mac and Linux).

[Zoo for Zotero](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mickstarify.zooforzotero): An android app for Zotero.

[Zotero iOS](https://www.zotero.org/iosbeta): The official Zotero app for iPhone and iPad.
\
\
\
*Aqueous geochemical calculations*

[PHREEQC notepad++](https://www.hydrochemistry.eu/downl.html): The best version for working with PHREEQC when you have experience.

[PHREEQCi](https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/PHREEQC/phreeqci-3.7.1-15876.msi): The best version for getting started with PHREEQC.
\
\
\
*Crystal structure visualization*

[VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/)

[VESTA tutorial](http://www.revistareduca.es/index.php/reduca-geologia/article/view/1959): Tutorial for visualising structures using VESTA (in Spanish).
\
\
\
*X-Ray diffraction analysis*

[Profex](https://www.profex-xrd.org/)

[Profex youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNxka_-vfLfqGdRO-cIHA4A): Tutorials, tips and Profex tutorials, tips and update reviews.
\
\
\
\
**Websites**

*Mineral database*

[Mindat](https://www.mindat.org/): The most complete mineral database.

[Webmineral](http://webmineral.com/): Outdated website. However, it has a very interesting tool to search for minerals by diffraction peaks.

[RRUFF](https://rruff.info/): Mineral database including Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction.
\
\
\
*Crystal structure database*

[American Mineralogist crystal structure database](http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/amcsd.php)

[Crystallography Open Database](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/)
