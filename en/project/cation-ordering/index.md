Some minerals are composed by two or more cations that can be arranged in the crystal structure in different ways, e.g. dolomite, norsethite and LDH. In many of these cases, it is interesting to know how these cations are arranged, as this information allows, for example, to understand their formation process or how it affects their properties.
