summary: "Application of minerals for foliar fertilization"
---

In this project led by Dr. Victoria Fern√°ndez, we investigated the usefulness of various minerals in aqueous suspensions for use as foliar fertilisers. To this end, we studied the dissolution kinetics of the minerals and their behaviour in equilibrium. We are also studying other compounds for the development of foliar formulations.
