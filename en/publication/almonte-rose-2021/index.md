abstract: Rose petals can involve high water contact angles together with drop adhesion
  which are antagonistic wetting properties. Petal surfaces have a cuticle, a layer
  that is generally considered a continuous, hydrophobic lipid coating. The peculiar
  properties of rose petals are not fully understood and have only been associated
  with high surface roughness at different scales. Here, the chemical and structural
  features of natural upper and lower petal surfaces are analyzed by atomic force
  microscopy (AFM). Both rose petal surfaces are statistically equivalent and have
  very high roughness at all scales from 5 nm to 10 µm. At the nanoscale, surfaces
  are fractal-like with an extreme fractal dimension close to df = 2.5. A major nanoscale
  variability is also observed which leads to large (nanoscale) wettability changes.
  To model the effect of roughness and chemical variability on wetting properties,
  a single wetting parameter is introduced. This approach enables to explain the Rose
  Petal Effect using a conceptually simple scheme. The described fundamental mechanisms
  leading to high contact angles together with drop adhesion can be applied to any
  natural and synthetic surface. Apart from introducing a new approach for characterizing
  a biological surface, these results can trigger new developments on nanoscale wetting
  and bio-inspired functional surfaces.
