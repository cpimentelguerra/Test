abstract: This work shows the results of a detailed structural analysis of the deformation belts of Lavinia Planitia. Ridge belts and graben and groove belts can be observed at the studied area, while wrinkle ridges and large individual grooves predominate in the smooth plains. Transcurrent components of displacement are commonly observed, and transpression and transtension zones are the rule rather than the exception at most of the studied belts. Along-strike azimuth changes of deformation belts are accommodated by internal variations in the predominance of contractional, transcurrent or extensional structures. The material of the surrounding plains embays most of these deformation belts. The kinematic analysis of this complex network of tectonic structures suggests a broadly synchronous activity of contractional, transcurrent and extensional structures. The maximum horizontal shortening axis determined in this work describes a steady, semi-circular pattern centered at Alpha Regio. This deformation continued, although with subdued activity, after embayment of the deformation belts by the material of the plains. Future study of the tectonic evolution of the lowland plains should take into account the importance of the coeval history of neighboring uplands and lowlands.
