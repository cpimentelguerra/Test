abstract: 'Because of the widespread presence of foreign substrates in natural settings,
  mineral precipitation usually occurs via heterogeneous nucleation. This process
  is controlled by the interplay between the fluid supersaturation and interfacial
  energies present between the fluid, nucleus, and substrate. Among a number of physicochemical
  parameters, the surface wetting properties have been shown to be a key parameter
  controlling heterogeneous nucleation. The present study aims at elucidating the
  pathway and kinetics of CaCO3 heterogeneous nucleation on a set of phlogopite micas
  with and without fluorine/hydroxyl substitutions, yielding substrates with contrasting
  hydrophilicity. Our results show that, irrespective of surface wetting properties,
  amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is formed during the early stages. The surface
  wetting properties have a strong effect on the crystallization kinetics: ACC precipitates
  persist longer on the hydrophilic (hydroxylated) surface than on the less hydrophilic
  (fluorinated) one. We show that this stabilization could have a thermodynamic origin
  because of the lower interfacial free energy between the hydrated amorphous precursor
  and the hydrophilic substrate. These results are highly relevant for biomineralization
  studies, where differences in wetting properties of organic moieties present in
  calcifying organisms could be used to accelerate or decelerate the crystallization
  of the initially formed amorphous precursor phase.'
