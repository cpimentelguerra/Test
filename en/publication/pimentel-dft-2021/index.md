abstract: 'Norsethite, BaMg(CO3)2, is an interesting mineral that can be used to investigate
  processes leading to the formation of dolomite and other dolomite-type structures.
  To this end, it is first necessary to study in detail the Ba–Mg cation arrangement
  in the crystal structure of norsethite. In this work, first-principles calculations
  based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used to simulate cation ordering
  for the crystal structures of two BaMg(CO3)2 polymorphs: the low-temperature polymorph
  (up to ∼360 K), α-norsethite (R3̅c), and the high-temperature polymorph (above ∼360
  K), β-norsethite (R3̅m). We found that for both structural variants of norsethite,
  the most stable cation arrangements are those with the alternation of barium and
  magnesium layers along the c-axis. Furthermore, we have adequately simulated nonstoichiometric
  β-norsethite structures since some synthetic norsethites were found to have an excess
  of magnesium, which seems to favor the crystallization of β-norsethite at room temperature.'
