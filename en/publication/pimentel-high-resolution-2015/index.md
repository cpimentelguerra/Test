abstract: 'In this paper, we present high-resolution friction force microscopy (FFM) images of the (100) face of kyanite (Al2SiO5) immersed in water. These images show an almost rectangular lattice presumably defined by the protruding oxygen of AlO6 polyhedra. Surface lattice parameters measured on two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) plots of recorded high-resolution friction maps are in good agreement with lattice parameters calculated from the bulk mineral structure. Friction measurements performed along the [001] and [010] directions on the kyanite (100) face provide similar friction coefficients μ ≈ 0.10, even if the sequences of AlO6 polyhedra are different along the two crystallographic directions.'
