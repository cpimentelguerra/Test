abstract: 'Tungstate chemical gardens have been prepared for the first time. The synthesis was carried out using cobalt(II) chloride and sodium tungstate. The reaction occurred in three steps: chimney formation, swelling, and upwelling of the chemical garden. This result opens the door to a new variety of materials.'
