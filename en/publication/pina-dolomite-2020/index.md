abstract: Dolomite is a carbonate mineral frequently found in sedimentary rocks from
  Proterozoic to Holocene. In the Iberian Peninsula, dolomites appear in a wide number
  of geological formations and they can be considered as representative of dolomites
  crystallised in most (post)sedimentary environments on Earth. In this paper, we
  present a first systematic study of the cation order of dolomites formed from Neoproterozoic
  to late Holocene. We found that the lowest values of cation order (quantified by
  measuring I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios on diffractograms) mainly correspond to dolomites
  formed in about the last 30 Myr. In contrast, older dolomites usually reach maximum
  I01.5/I11.0 intensity ratios. Furthermore, higher values of cation order seem to
  be related to higher values of the full width half maximum of 10.4 diffraction peaks
  (FWHM10.4). Assuming that a decrease in FWHM10.4 (i.e. an increase in the crystallite
  size) in sedimentary environments indicates mineral ripening, our results show that
  Mg-Ca ordering in dolomites might take place mainly by a dissolution-(re)crystallisation
  ageing process operating over large geological periods.
