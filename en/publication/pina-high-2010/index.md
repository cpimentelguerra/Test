abstract: In this paper we present high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) images
  of dolomite (104) cleavage surfaces immersed in pure water. These images show a
  rectangular lattice with surface unit cell dimensions in general agreement with
  those derived from the dolomite bulk structure. Furthermore, the two-dimensional
  fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) plots of the high resolution images exhibit a pattern
  of periodicities consistent with both the alternate orientation of the carbonate
  groups and the positions for calcium and magnesium atoms on the dolomite (104) surface.
  However, the Mg2+ and Ca2+ sublattices could not be resolved. Finally, the images
  in both the real and the Fourier space do not reveal any clear evidence of reconstruction
  of the dolomite (104) surfaces.
