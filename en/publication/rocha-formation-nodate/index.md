abstract: Methane-rich water moves through conduits beneath the seafloor whose surfaces
  are formed through precipitation reactions. To understand how such submarine fluid
  conduit and venting systems form and grow, we develop a detailed mathematical model
  for this reaction–advection system and we quantify the evolution of an ensemble
  of similar filaments. We show that this growth can be described by a superposition
  of advection and dispersion. We analyse analogue laboratory experiments of chemical-garden
  type to study the growth of a single filament undergoing a precipitation reaction
  with the surrounding environment. We apply these findings to geological fluid conduit
  and venting systems, showing that their irregular trajectories can lead to very
  effective spreading within the surrounding seabed, thus enhancing contact and exchanges
  of chemicals between the conduit and external fluids. We discuss how this methane
  venting leads to the formation of marine authigenic carbonate rocks, and for confirmation
  we analyse two field samples from the Gulf of Cadiz for composition and mineralogy
  of the precipitates. We note the implications of this work for hydrate melting and
  methane escape from the seabed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights
