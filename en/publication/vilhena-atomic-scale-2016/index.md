abstract: The sliding of a sharp nanotip on graphene completely immersed in water
  is investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) and atomic force microscopy. MD simulations
  predict that the atomic-scale stick–slip is almost identical to that found in ultrahigh
  vacuum. Furthermore, they show that water plays a purely stochastic role in sliding
  (solid-to-solid) friction. These observations are substantiated by friction measurements
  on graphene grown on Cu and Ni, where, oppositely of the operation in air, lattice
  resolution is readily achieved. Our results promote friction force microscopy in
  water as a robust alternative to ultra-high-vacuum measurements.
